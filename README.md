## General description 
**GView** framework is a powerful tool for examining files or any data with a defined structure, such as buffers or memory zones. Users can leverage the diverse range of available visualization options to effectively analyze and interpret the information.

On the other hand, from the perspective of developers, **GView** offers a flexible platform to create plugins that can parse various data structures. Developers can harness this capability to develop customized views and enhance the analysis capabilities of **GView**. By creating plugins, developers can extend the framework's functionality and tailor it to specific data formats or requirements, enabling more efficient and insightful data analysis.

## Smart Viewers

**Smart viewers** are software components designed to display data in various formats or representations. In the context of a **data identifier plugin**, multiple smart viewers are usually available, with one being designated as the primary viewer. This setup allows users to effortlessly switch between different viewers, selecting the visualization method that most effectively meets their specific needs.

### Buffer Viewer

Interprets data as a binary buffer and possesses the ability to identify and highlight specific portions of the buffer using various specifications such as regular expressions, offsets, content patterns, and more. It can effectively detect and highlight strings in both ASCII and Unicode formats. Additionally, the view is equipped with the capability to adjust code pages, enabling the clear representation of characters from diverse languages.

### Text Viewer
Interprets data as a sequence of characters arranged in lines, each separated by an identifier. It offers comprehensive support for various line separators, including CR, LF, CRLF, and LFCR. The view also provides flexible options for alignment, allowing different interpretations of the TAB character, and offers customizable wrapping settings for each line.

### Lexical Viewer
This viewer leverages the lexer provided by the **data identifier plugin**. It offers advanced functionalities such as displaying text with highlighted colors, enabling the folding or collapsing of code blocks, and incorporating diverse refactoring operations like variable and function renaming. Additionally, a data identification plugin can provide a range of language-specific transformations that can be applied to the text.

### Image Viewer
Visualize graphical representation of different image formats.

![Image Viewer](./docs/source/_static/ImageView.gif)

### Table Viewer
Represents data that has a tabular format in an organized manner (CSV, TSV, SQL databases).

![Table Viewer](./docs/source/_static/GridView.gif)

### Dissasm Viewer
Presents the content of binary files through a disassembly process that examines the code and deduces relevant details like imported function names, parameter names, and string pointers. This disassembly process relies on the Capstone library. In addition, the **data identifier plugin** plays a crucial role by providing essential information such as the required decoding method (e.g., x86, x64) and the code's entry point offset.

### Container Viewer
The viewer displays a range of components that can be extracted using the current **data identifier plugin**. This versatile functionality can be applied in various scenarios, such as extracting files from an archive or extracting streams from a PCAP file.

## Data Identifier Plugins

In the context of data analysis, a **data identifier plugin** serves as a valuable component capable of examining a buffer, whether in its binary form or translated into a textual representation. Its primary function is to automatically extract relevant and specific information from the buffer based on its type. To facilitate a comprehensive analysis, each data identifier plugin is equipped with dedicated panels designed to display detailed information specific to the identified data type.

| Plugin name | Data Type | Capabilities |

## Architecture

The architecture flow can be summarized as it follows:
1. Determine whether the content is binary or textual in nature. In the case of textual content, make an attempt to identify the encoding and decode it into a standardized format such as UTF-16.

2. Explore all available **data identifier plugins** to locate one capable of interpreting the given data. If no specific plugin is found, fallback to a generic plugin that solely distinguishes between binary and textual files.

3. The **data identifier plugin** selects suitable smart viewers tailored to the current data. Users have the flexibility to switch between these plugins and employ them to extract artifacts or data from the existing content.

4. Repeat steps 1 to 3 for the extracted components. This iterative process relies on artifacts obtained in previous steps to drive subsequent analysis and extraction.

As for the actual code components involved in the project, here are a high-level view and a core view:

## Building
### Tools used
CMake is used to build the entire project regardless of the platform.README.md
Usage of [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) in our build pipeline can be seen [here](/.github/workflows/ci.yml).
### Supported platforms
#### Windows
Works out of the box using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).                                                  
#### OSX
We are using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg). It requires [curl](https://curl.se) installation.

Unfortunately, some vcpkg ports require manual installation via [brew package manager](https://brew.sh) of [pkg-config](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/pkg-config) before building the project.
#### Linux (Intel)
Requires pkg-config package.

Works using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) and [curl](https://curl.se) (for vcpkg).

#### Linux (ARM (M1))
Requires pkg-config package.

Uncomment this line in top level CMakeLists.txt for Linux ARM architectures.

This will require manual installation of ninja (ninja-build).
```
# set(ENV{VCPKG_FORCE_SYSTEM_BINARIES} 1)
```
## CI/CD
We are using `Github Actions` ensuring that the project builds on `Windows`, `OSX` & `Linux` and we are working towards creating artifacts, storing them and eventually building a release flow.
For static analysis, we are using `CodeQL` & `Microsoft C++ Code Analysis`.

## Documentation 
The project uses Sphinx as the main documentation engine. Sphinx sources can be located under `docs` folder.

On every commit to `main`, a compiled version of the Sphinx documentation is published to `gh-pages` and then to docs.

## First run

There's currently a pre-release/beta GitHub CI/CD pipeline that creates an archive for each supported operating system.
It can be downloaded and the package can be run (via main binary - `GView` - but there's a catch depending on the platform).
The supported process architecture (via GitHub Actions) is Intel, but it can be built for ARM as well.

### Windows

Runs out of the box (tested on Windows 10 x64), just unzip the release archive and run `GView.exe`.

### Linux

Ubuntu 18.04 is [deprecated](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-08-09-github-actions-the-ubuntu-18-04-actions-runner-image-is-being-deprecated-and-will-be-removed-by-12-1-22) in GitHub actions. Our precompiled binaries doesn't work there (GLIBC version is too old).

We are currently building on Ubuntu 20.04 (Intel) and this allows us to run `GView` on Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 22.04.

### MacOS / OSX

You'll get this warning for each GView binary from the package you're downloading:
```
macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware.
Chrome downloaded this file today at 22:31.
```
Unfortunately, unless you entirely temporarily disable `Gatekeeper` (which would put your computer to a risk) you need to manually allow all the binaries, one by one, to run. This process cannot be avoided until we digitally sign the binaries (MacOS signing and notarization). 

## Start contributing
- Clone this repository using recurse submodules: 
```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules <your-repo-link/GView.git>
```

Contributors can install sphinx using `pip install -r requirements.txt`, this will install Sphinx tooling and `sphinx_rtd_theme`. Local building is done with `make html`

After the command executes successfully, the html pages can be found in the `build` folder.
